# Personal Website
My personal website using GatbsyJs. This was my first Gatsby project 

# What I Learned
I learned how to use GatsbyJs and GraphQL. I am also using Contentful as my "Model" part of my application where my content lives. I also first designed the website using AdobeXD and got inspiration from multiple posts on Dribbble. This was my first attempt at creating a "clean design."
